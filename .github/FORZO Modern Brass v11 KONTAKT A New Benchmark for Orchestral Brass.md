## What is FORZO Modern Brass v1.1 KONTAKT?
 
FORZO Modern Brass v1.1 KONTAKT is a brass virtual instrument library for Kontakt and Kontakt Player. It features a 26-piece brass orchestra recorded at Skywalker Sound, one of the most renowned soundstages in the world. The library contains 25 GB of uncompressed samples, covering a wide range of brass instruments and techniques.
 
FORZO Modern Brass v1.1 KONTAKT is divided into three main engines: Traditional, Hybrid Cinematic, and Loop Designer. Each engine has its own interface and controls, allowing you to customize and manipulate the brass sounds to your liking.
 
### Traditional Engine
 
The Traditional engine is where you can find the core brass sounds of FORZO. It includes 12 French horns, four trumpets, eight trombones (tenor, bass, and contra bass), and two tubas. You can choose from over 100 articulations, such as sustains, staccatos, legatos, mutes, clusters, bends, flutters, rips, and more. You can also adjust the dynamics, expression, vibrato, release trails, and microphone positions of each instrument.
 
The Traditional engine also features an Ensemble Designer mode, where you can layer up to five different brass sections together and control them with a single set of parameters. This mode allows you to create rich and powerful brass ensembles with ease.
 
### Hybrid Cinematic Engine
 
The Hybrid Cinematic engine is where you can unleash your creativity and transform the brass sounds into hybrid cinematic textures. It includes four sound sources: two from the Traditional engine and two from a collection of synthesized sounds. You can mix and match these sources using the XY pad, and apply various effects and modulations to create unique and dynamic sounds.
 
The Hybrid Cinematic engine also features a Macro Control mode, where you can assign up to six parameters to a single knob and automate them with an LFO or an envelope. This mode allows you to create complex and evolving sounds with minimal effort.
 
### Loop Designer Engine
 
The Loop Designer engine is where you can find over 400 tempo-synced brass loops that can add rhythmic and melodic interest to your music. It includes four loop sources: two from the Traditional engine and two from a collection of processed loops. You can blend these sources using the XY pad, and adjust the pitch, volume, pan, filter, distortion, delay, and reverb of each loop.
 
The Loop Designer engine also features a Loop Mutator mode, where you can slice and rearrange the loops using a step sequencer. You can also randomize the slices or apply different effects to each slice. This mode allows you to create new and original loops from the existing ones.
